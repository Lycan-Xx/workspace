# Authentication Flow Modifications

## Previous Configuration

### Email Validation
- Frontend enforced strict email format validation (`/\S+@\S+\.\S+/`)
- Supabase required a valid email before signup
- Users couldn't signup until their email is in a valid format

### Verification Process
- Supabase sent verification emails automatically
- Email confirmation was mandatory
- System blocked login attempts for unverified accounts

## Changes Made

### Code Modifications
1. Removed email format validation from [`SignIn.jsx`](src/components/EvaultPlatform/signin/SignIn.jsx)
2. Updated [`authService.js`](backend/supabase/services/authService.js) to:
   - Auto-confirm emails in development
   - Skip verification checks
3. Configured [`supabase.js`](src/lib/supabase.js) with `disableSignupEmailVerification: true`

### Supabase Dashboard Changes
1. Disabled "Enable email confirmations"
2. Disabled "Require email verification before login"
3. Saved authentication settings

## Current Behavior
- Accepts any email format during signup
- Skips email verification completely  
- Allows immediate login after signup
- Works with mock/test email addresses
- Still maintains security in production (when properly configured)

## Purpose
These changes were made to:
- Streamline development testing
- Allow quick account creation 
- Remove verification barriers during development
- Maintain flexibility for production configuration
